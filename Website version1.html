        <h1>International English Language Testing System</h1>
        <p>IELTS is accepted by most Australian, British, Canadian, Irish and New Zealand academic institutions, by over <br>3,000 academic institutions in the United States, and by various professional organisations across the world.</p>
        <p>IELTS is the only Secure English Language Test approved by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) for visa customers <br>applying both outside and inside the UK. It also meets requirements for immigration to Australia, where TOEFL<br> and Pearson Test of English Academic are also accepted, and New Zealand. In Canada, IELTS, TEF, or CELPIP <br> are accepted by the immigration authority.</p>
        <p>No minimum score is required to pass the test. An IELTS result or Test Report Form is issued to all test takers <br>with a score from "band 1" ("non-user") to "band 9" ("expert user") and each institution sets a different threshold. <br>There is also a "band 0" score for those who did not attempt the test. Institutions are advised not to<br> consider a report older than two years to be valid, unless the user proves that they have worked to maintain their level.</p>
